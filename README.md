# 🍚 Rice Type Classification

This project focuses on classifying different types of rice grains using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a reliable model that can predict the type of rice based on its physical characteristics.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains morphological features extracted from images of five rice varieties:

* **Basmati**
* **Jasmine**
* **Arborio**
* **Ipsala**
* **Karacadag**

Each sample includes features such as:

* Area
* Perimeter
* Major/Minor Axis Length
* Eccentricity
* Convex Area
* Solidity
* Aspect Ratio

### Source

The dataset is publicly available on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), depending on the one you're using.

## 🧠 Model

We trained and evaluated several models including:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Best Performing Model:

> `Random Forest` achieved the highest accuracy with optimal hyperparameters.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python 3.x
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Results

* Accuracy: 95%+
* Confusion Matrix and Classification Report used to evaluate performance.
* Feature importance and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA were explored.
